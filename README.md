# MLflow for Machine Learning Deployment. 

This repository explores the different approaches we can use to make a model available for use. 

# Deploy MLflow Models using Local Inference Server

### Iris Classifier usecase

The iris dataset is a classic and very easy multi-class classification dataset. More information [here](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_iris.html)

This use case illustrates the basic components of the inference process. It serves as a refresher on experiment tracking and provides an easy introduction to the main topic: inference. The model's signature is relatively simple, allowing a focus on the different mechanisms that can be used when the model is deployed on a local server.
